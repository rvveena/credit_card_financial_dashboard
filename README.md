 Credit Card Financial Report Dashboard

💡 Project Description

This project focuses on developing an advanced Credit Card Financial Report Dashboard designed to provide stakeholders with real-time insights into key performance metrics and trends in credit card operations. The dashboard empowers decision-makers by presenting critical data in a visual format, making it easier to monitor and analyze various aspects of credit card usage, transactions, and customer demographics.

The goal is to optimize operational efficiency, streamline decision-making processes, and enable data-driven strategies in the credit card management system.

 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Power BI: Used for data visualization, dashboard creation, and interactive reports.
- MS SQL: Another database used for storing transaction data, enabling SQL-based querying and reporting.

 💡 Skills Showcased in this Project

- Data Extraction: Importing raw data from multiple sources into SQL databases.
- Data Cleaning: Cleaning and preprocessing data to ensure consistency and accuracy.
- Data Transformation: Using SQL and Power BI's DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to manipulate and structure data for reporting.
- Data Visualization: Designing and creating interactive, dynamic dashboards for real-time insights.

📅🔍 Project Approach

The project follows a systematic approach to build a comprehensive financial dashboard:

1. Data Import: Data is imported into SQL databases (PostgreSQL and MS SQL) from various sources.
2. Database Connection: Power BI is connected to the SQL databases to fetch the required data for analysis.
3. Data Transformation: The data is cleaned, formatted, and transformed using Power BI’s data transformation tools.
4. Calculated Columns & Measures: Key metrics are calculated using DAX formulas to derive useful KPIs and insights.
5. Interactive Dashboard Design: Visual elements such as charts, tables, and slicers are added to create an intuitive and interactive dashboard.
6. Insight Generation: The dashboard is used to generate actionable insights and trends, providing a clear understanding of credit card performance and customer behavior.
